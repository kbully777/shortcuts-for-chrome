Currently, this module sets up extension context menu. Instantiate background to activate this functionality. Dragging Makes child nodes of some DOM element draggable, using native HTML drag and drop. Menu Menu panel is a DOM elements that shows a list of links. This menu panel is drawn dynamically by creating all menu elements programmatically on render() . The parent instantiating the menu will call render. Parent must then add the returned menu to DOM tree to display it to user. Popup This is the main class for the popup window that shows when user clicks extension icon. This class is responsible for: saving/restoring persistent data and rendering the menu panel. This popup view can easily be extended to display other content, but currently it renders the menu panel only. Background \u00b6 This module sets up all functionality and event handlers in the background context of the extension. Currently, this module sets up extension context menu. Instantiate background to activate this functionality. Kind : global class new Background() \u00b6 Initialize background scripts.

This callback function will allow initiator to bind additional events to draggable elements. onDragEndCallback function After drag is done, this callback function notifies initiator that the item order within the draggable area has changed. Example Creating a new draggable 1 2 3 4 5 6 new Draggable ( \"id\" , containerElement , onElementRender ( element : Element ) { ... }, onDragEndCallback ( ids : Array < String > ) { ... } ); Menu \u00b6 Menu panel is a DOM elements that shows a list of links.

User can pin and unpin menu items, and sort pinned menu items using drag and drop. This behavior is implemented by following 3 components: src/popup manages the extension popup window. It saves and restores user preferences It sets the visible content rendering inside the popup window Menu is currently the only possible view, so popup always renders the menu panel src/menu panel shows list of links.
